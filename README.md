# Example NextJS Version 13

Next.js offers four different rendering methods:

- Client-side rendering (CSR) is the default rendering method in Next.js. In CSR, the browser renders the page after it has been fetched from the server. This means that the browser must fetch all of the data for the page, including the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This can lead to slower page load times, especially for pages with a lot of data.

- Server-side rendering (SSR) renders the page on the server before it is sent to the browser. This means that the server fetches all of the data for the page and then renders it into HTML. The browser then receives the rendered HTML, which can lead to faster page load times. SSR also improves SEO, as search engines can index the rendered HTML.

- Static site generation (SSG) renders the page on the server at build time. This means that the page is rendered once, when the project is built, and then served statically from the server. This can lead to the fastest page load times, as the browser does not need to fetch any data. However, SSG can be less flexible than other rendering methods, as the page cannot be dynamically updated.

- Incremental static regeneration (ISR) is a new feature in Next.js that combines the benefits of SSG and SSR. ISR renders the page on the server at build time, but it can also be regenerated at runtime if the data changes. This means that ISR can provide the fast page load times of SSG with the flexibility of SSR.

Sure, here is a list that summarizes the key differences between the four rendering methods:

* **Client-side rendering (CSR)**
    * Pros:
        * Flexible
        * Easy to develop
        * Supports dynamic content
    * Cons:
        * Can be slow
        * Can be difficult to optimize for SEO
* **Server-side rendering (SSR)**
    * Pros:
        * Fast
        * Good for SEO
        * Supports dynamic content
    * Cons:
        * Can be difficult to develop
        * Can be difficult to update
* **Static site generation (SSG)**
    * Pros:
        * Fastest
        * Good for SEO
        * Easy to update
    * Cons:
        * Not flexible
        * Cannot support dynamic content
* **Incremental static regeneration (ISR)**
    * Pros:
        * Fast
        * Good for SEO
        * Flexible
        * Supports dynamic content
    * Cons:
        * Can be complex to implement

Ultimately, the best way to choose a rendering method is to experiment with different methods and see what works best for your project.
